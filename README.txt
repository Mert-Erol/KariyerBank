Basic career website

I write back-end with php.I don't use any other framework like Laravel or Codeigniter.But at the front-end MdBootstrap became a big helper for me.I develop this project because of my college education and like any other students,I started to code it 2 days before the deadline.I think I handled well this one.There are some visual problems but they are not major problems.Ä°t is my first project in github,I left some bugs on it so someday when I look at this project they will put a smile on my face (:
